The goal is finding connection weights of each attribute used for predicting the highest stock price. Prediction is made for the next day based only on the features from the previous day. Each connection weight represents one binary composed chromosome. There are a total of six attributes used for each company since its first day on the market: Open price, Closing price, Highest price, Lowest price, Volume and Adjusted closing price. The historical data was downloaded from the Yahoo Finance website and tested on six different companies.
